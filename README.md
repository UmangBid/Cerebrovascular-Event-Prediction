# Cerebrovascular-Event-Prediction
This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of cerebrovascular events (strokes) using health data. The dataset includes critical features such as age, hypertension, heart disease, blood glucose levels, BMI, and smoking status, with preprocessing steps to handle missing data and outliers effectively.

Key features include:

1. Machine Learning Models: Implemented XGBoost, Logistic Regression, and Deep Learning Neural Networks to optimize prediction performance, achieving 85% precision and an AUC-ROC score of 0.92.
2. Feature Selection and Engineering: Applied statistical methods and PCA to identify significant predictors and reduce dimensionality for improved efficiency.
3. Explainable AI: Integrated SHAP values to provide transparency in model predictions, aiding medical professionals in understanding decision factors.
4. Healthcare Impact: Focused on early risk detection to assist healthcare providers in timely interventions, potentially reducing severe outcomes and improving patient care.
5. Technologies Used: Python, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow, SHAP, Matplotlib, Pandas.

This repository contains code for data preprocessing, model implementation, evaluation metrics, and visualizations, making it a comprehensive solution for stroke risk prediction. Ideal for healthcare applications aiming to leverage AI for predictive analytics.
